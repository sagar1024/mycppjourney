# My self learning C++ journey

Started my computer science journey on Nov 2022 with C++. Initially, solved various pattern based problems, then tried to develop some games but couldnt build anything and then I solved a lot of problems on competitive coding platforms like Codeforces and leetcode, involving mathematics, ad-hoc, data structures and algorithms based problems.

Saving my code files here for backup :)
